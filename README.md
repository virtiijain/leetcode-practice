# LeetCode Practice 

This repository is a collection of problems I'm solving on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) as part of my daily coding practice.

I'm currently focusing on building problem-solving skills in **JavaScript**, starting with the **Easy** and **Medium** level problems.

## Structure
- `Easy/` – beginner-level problems
- `Medium/` – (coming soon!)
- `Hard/` – (coming soon!)

Each file contains:
- Accepted solution in JavaScript

## Why I'm Doing This

- To improve my DSA knowledge
- To build consistency and confidence
- To prepare for frontend interviews in the future

> I'm still learning & improving!
